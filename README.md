# Personal Golf

A Progressive Web App (PWA) built with **Ruby on Rails 8** that helps golfers organize, discover, and share knowledge to play their best golf. The app serves as a comprehensive knowledge management system for golf tips, routines, and course-specific insights.

## üèåÔ∏è Features

- **Personal Knowledge Collection**: Save and organize golf tips across all categories
- **AI-Powered Content**: Generate personalized tips using Google Gemini API
- **YouTube Integration**: Tips can include relevant instructional videos with thumbnails
- **Community-Driven**: Share knowledge and discover tips from other golfers
- **Course-Specific Insights**: Local knowledge and photos for golf courses
- **Progressive Web App**: Works offline, installable on mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Live sharing and notifications via Solid Cable

## Tip Types & Examples

- **Technical**: "Shallow the downswing by feeling the trail elbow lead the hips. Make 3 slow pump rehearsals, then swing at 80% to start the ball right-edge and draw back."
- **Mental game**: "Use box-breathing (4-4-4-4) while picking a tiny intermediate target. After exhale, commit to one swing thought: tempo only."
- **Preparation**: "Green-speed ladder drill: putt 10, 20, 30 feet stopping pin-high. Note the backstroke length that reliably reaches each distance and use it in the round."
- **Course management**: "When approach > 7-iron or into the wind, aim for the fat side. Take one extra club and swing 80% to avoid the short-side miss‚Äîbogeys drop fast with this rule."
- **Specific course**: "Example ‚Äì Hole 4, 175y par 3, water front-left: tee to right-center; long is safe. On afternoon headwinds, take one more club and flight it down."

### Available Tip Tags

These tags can be attached to tips for filtering and discovery:

- **Clubs**: driver, fairway_woods, long_irons, short_irons, wedges, putter
- **Shots**: full_shots, punch_shots, hook_shots, slice_shots, fairway_bunker, pitches, chips, flop_shots, greenside_bunker, long_putts, short_putts
- **Mental Game**: pre-shot_routine, visualization, breathing, focus, confidence, positive_self-talk, commitment, acceptance, emotional_control, routine_under_pressure, post-shot_processing

## üöÄ Rails 8 "No PaaS Required" Architecture

This app leverages Rails 8's simplified deployment stack:

- **SQLite**: Production-ready database with Rails 8 optimizations
- **Kamal 2**: Deploy anywhere with simple configuration

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Ruby on Rails 8.0.2
- **Language**: Ruby 3.3.7
- **Frontend**: Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite3 (production-ready)
- **Deployment**: Kamal 2 + Docker

## üéØ Core Models

```ruby
# User authentication (Rails 8 built-in)
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_secure_password
  has_many :tips, :saves, :sessions
end

# Golf tips and knowledge
class Tip < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user, :category
  has_many :saves, counter_cache: true

  # Real-time broadcasts
  broadcasts_to :category

  # Background processing
  after_create_commit :process_tip_async
end

# User's saved collection
class Save < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user, :tip
  validates :user_id, uniqueness: { scope: :tip_id }
end
```
